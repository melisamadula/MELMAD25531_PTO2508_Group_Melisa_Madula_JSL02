# JSL02 Project Brief: Task Input and Status Validation System

## Description:

This project involves implementing a JavaScript-based task entry system where users can input two tasks with complete details, ensuring data consistency and validation. The system will guide users through entering valid task titles, descriptions, and statuses, enforcing correct formatting while maintaining code clarity and maintainability.
**For the programmer**, the console will serve as visual aid upon inspection - on the progress of the user.

## Task:

We were tasked to successfully input the given coding solution of the HTML and CSS files into our project (whether by downloading/ copying, and pasting the files in). Then, we were to proceed by adding and completing a full JavaScript file, for interactivity. Lastly, we needed to add a professional README - with a thorough breakdown of our project requirements and process.

## Techonolgy:

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## Features:

Console readability, for the developer.
